# LUV-Similarity

# Abstract 
In the field of colour science and image processing, quantifying colours into meaningful information can be hard because the perception of colour is an individual experience and it is difficult to measure. This research proposed a method of comparing colours perceptually based on the CIELUV colour space. The Luv Similarity was created after observing the movement of the point of the same colour in the CIELUV space at different external brightness. This algorithm can judge and map the similarity of colour between two images while minimizing the lighting effect.
